_**Assessing and Forecasting the Economic Impact of the UKâ€™s Video Games Industry using a Hybrid Machine Learning Model**_

This is a repository for the UCL Company Project, aimed at forecasting the economic contribution of the UK's video game industry using a hybrid LSTM-RF model.
The repository consists of 5 notebooks for convenience:
  The 'Primary' notebook contains all of the data cleaning, pre-processing, model experimentation and model training.
  The 'Data Exploration' notebook contains all of the data exploration and visualizations created for the 'Data' section of the dissertation.
  The 'Forecast and Feature Importance' notebook contains the forecasting model and its results, as well as the feature importance from the random forest component.
  The 'Benchmarks' notebook consists of comparison traditional statistical models.
  The 'Time Steps' notebook contains experimentation of the hybrid model using different time steps.
